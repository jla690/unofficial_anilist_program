Unofficial Anilist website local page using FastAPI/React/Tailwind CSS for learning purposes.

DONE:
- Logging in
- Checking user list of manga and anime
- Searching
- Saving title specific (progress, status, score)
- Details of titles
- Converting to React/Typescript/Tailwind
- Logging out functionality
- List of recommendations
- List of characters
- docker is somewhat working... (reload doesn't work on vite)

TODO:
- Show trending media for anime and manga with thumbnails
- Show more stuff on anime detail (should be trivial, just annoying)
- ~~Convert this to Javascript instead of Python, to learn different things~~
- use redis
- fix graph
